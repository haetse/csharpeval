# Introduction

C# does not include a built-in method to evaluate a string during runtime, like Javascript's eval() or VBScript's Eval().

ExpressionEvaluator is a lightweight, simple and free library capable of parsing and compiling simple to medium complexity C# expressions. It features a Antlr-based tokenizer and parser and generates a LINQ Expression tree which is then compiled into a function.

Applications for an expression parser and compiler are usually in the form of embedded code or user-defined expressions that need to be executed against runtime objects. 

# How can I use this library?

* An [Experimental Music Compiler](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/experimental-music-compiler/370af565-51c8-4cd0-af6a-32d1e9a6690a) for Windows Mobile
* Dynamic data-bound XML templates
* User-defined conditional code stored in configuration files
* Customer-defined queries
* User-defined execution parameters for pluggable controls

If you have downloaded and used this library, I'd like to know about it's usage! Feel free to [let me know about it](https://www.codeplex.com/site/users/contact/rupertavery?OriginalUrl=https://csharpeval.codeplex.com).

# Disclaimer

This is *not* a fully C#-compliant compiler, and as such features may be missing and there may be bugs or discrepancies in how the parser and compiler work.  If you wish to use this library in production code do so at your own risk.

# PCL version
This fork of charpeval is built as Portable Class Library (Profile111), targeting
* .NET Framework 4.5 and later
* Windows 8 and later
* ASP.NET Core 5.0
* Windows Phone 8.1
* Xamarin.Android
* Xamarin.IOS

Note! I have only tested .NET Framework 4.5 and Windows Universal 10.0

This is a breaking change compared to Ruperts orginal which works on .NET 4.0.
